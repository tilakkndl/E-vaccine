  <h1>Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV)</h1>
  <p>Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is a pneumococcal vaccine made with the conjugate vaccine method and used to protect infants, young children,
     and adults against disease caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus).
     It contains purified capsular polysaccharide of pneumococcal serotypes conjugated to a carrier protein to improve antibody response compared to the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine.
     The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of the conjugate vaccine in routine immunizations given to children. </p>
  
 <p>Pneumococcal disease refers to any illness caused by pneumococcal bacteria. These bacteria can cause many types of illnesses, including pneumonia, which is an infection of the lungs.  Pneumococcal bacteria are one of the most common causes of pneumonia.

    Besides pneumonia, pneumococcal bacteria can also cause:
    <ul>
    <li>Ear infections</li>
    <li>Sinus infections</li>
<li>Meningitis (infection of the tissue covering the brain and spinal cord)</li>
<li>Bacteremia (infection of the blood) </li>
    </ul>
    Anyone can get pneumococcal disease, but children under 2 years old are at the highest risk.
    
    Most pneumococcal infections are mild. However, some can result in long-term problems, such as brain damage or hearing loss. Meningitis, bacteremia, and pneumonia caused by pneumococcal disease can be fatal.</p>
