  <h1> Measles - Rubella (MR)</h1>
  <p>Measles - Rubella is used to protect children against measles and rubella which are highly contagious viral diseases.
     While measles kills nearly 49,000 children in the country every year, rubella causes irreversible birth defects.
    There is no treatment for measles and rubella, but both diseases can be prevented by vaccination.
    By vaccinating all children in the age group of 9 months to 15 years, Nepal aims to eliminate both measles and rubella.</p>
    <p>Both girls and boys are at an equal risk of getting infected as well as transmitting the rubella virus, if not already protected against the disease.
         Therefore, both boys and girls need to take MR vaccine in routine immunization as well as during MR vaccination campaign.</p>
    <p>It stimulates the immune system to act against microorganisms to prevent such infections. These infections usually occur in childhood.

        MR-Vac Vaccine is to be administered by a healthcare professional.
         It may cause redness, pain, and swelling at the site of injection.
          However, this is temporary and usually resolves on its own.
           Do not skip any doses and follow your doctor’s instructions carefully to get maximum benefit.</p>
